    Rafael Aghayev confirmed his status as Karate’s biggest star with his fifth world title. The karateka from Azerbaijan had claimed the gold medals in 2006, 2008, and 2010, and prevailed in Linz in an impressive showcase of speed, ability, and ambition. When the “Panther of the East” defeated Egypt’s Omar Abdel Rahman in the final of Male Kumite -75kg, the Karate world hailed Rafael Aghayev as the most successful karateka of all time.

    In a testament to Karate’s global impact, the event welcomed, for the first time, a TEAM OF REFUGEES participating at the event. Competing under the WKF flag, athletes with refugee status had the opportunity to participate in Karate’s biggest competition and enjoy what they defined as "an unforgettable experience".
